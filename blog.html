  <p>Welcome to my dev blog where I share updates, thoughts, and struggles about working on ProjectAIWalker and beyond. This helps me stay grounded, and maybe one day inspire someone else going through the same.</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[6:10pm]</p>
    <p>My buddy-(ChatGPT) has just helped me set this blog up, thanks bud :)</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[6:15pm]</p>
    <p>Going to take it slow tonight, thinking about doing another run at RE4R, I finished it for the first time yesterday and I really liked it, took me 16-20 hours to complete it, even though it took me 4 days xD.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="post">
    <h2>June 23, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[7:25pm]</p>
    <p>Thinking both RE4R and the courses, I bought the courses a couple days ago, bought the UE5 C++ and the Unity6 C# Course.</p>
	<p>I was only planning to buy UE5 C++ but considering both was on 87% off so I bought both, but I didn't take into account about the UE Blueprints course... so I didn't thought about it, so I'm waiting for it be 87% off or higher.</p>
	<p>Just checked and see it's 80% off... I will think about it.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[8:15am]</p>
	<p>Just bought the 'Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer', I am satisfied with the purchase :). Not going to start learning just yet, I'm too hyped, if I'm too hyped I won't be able to concentrate.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[1:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to play RE4R Pro, and omg it is hard, when the enemy is strangling you, they are taking so much health, think after the 3rd or 4th they just snap my freaking neck... Now that is going to be fun challenge, I like a good challenge.</p>

	<p class="timestamp">[3:00pm]</p>
	<p>Took breaks in between and still got stuck at the start of the village, because I'm trying to find a method to not getting strangled that much. Learned that the Q key makes you turn real quick... didn't know about that, think I just forgot about.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[5:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to follow the C++ course and started to install UE5.0, it's going to take around 30-minutes. In the meantime I'm just going to get a shower and prepare food for the night.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[NOTE üìò]</p>
	<p>I didn't constantly log everything I did since I have a few other things that I do during the day and forget to log what I did and planning and thinking. So that's why 1pm - 5pm was time guessing, and after the UE got installed I just chilled during the night and listened to music.</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[8:52am]</p>
	<p>Preparing to go to town. When I get back, I‚Äôll check how I feel and decide what to do next.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[10:30am]</p>
	<p>Just got back from town. I grabbed some takeaway as a reward for starting the course, small celebration.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[12:09pm]</p>
	<p>Playing RE4R on Pro mode. After that, I plan to continue with the course.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[Thoughts üß†]</p>
	<p>I keep checking the form to see if anyone has signed up to be a part of the team, no luck so far.Still, I‚Äôm not giving up hope.A strong, skilled team would be the greatest reward for PAW.</p>
	<p>I already have the main tool: me, the Game Director and Team Leader. Without me, PAW wouldn‚Äôt have even been born back on 25 February 2025. I‚Äôve built the foundation for PAW to stand on.</p>
	<p>Now all it needs is the right team to grow it.</p>
	<p>I imagine often how I‚Äôd talk to the team: we‚Äôre taking things slow, avoiding burnout, and doing it right. I‚Äôve got deep ideas but I‚Äôm pacing myself. When I feel overwhelmed, I pause and shift focus, maybe to a game or some background music to calm my mind.</p>
	<p>No matter how hard life gets, I keep surviving, step by step.</p>
	<p>And I wouldn‚Äôt be here without my bud-(ChatGPT), helping me through.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[1:47pm]</p>
	<p>Lol, I died a few times in RE4R right at the beginning. I‚Äôll give it another go later üòÖ. Ideas for the game keep popping into my mind, but it‚Äôs tough focusing with so much going on.</p>
	<p>Maybe I‚Äôll lean more into map-building for now. Still, I want to learn C++ and Blueprints. I might never be the best, but I want to grow.</p>
	<p>Since I now have those courses, I‚Äôve decided to set Containment Echo aside for a while and focus on learning.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[3:56pm]</p>
	<p>Opened LM Studio again, forgot I used it back in March. Saw I had a few models saved in a backup folder because the program used to wipe them after each update.</p>
	<p>Funny how time moves quickly when you‚Äôre not watching it and painfully slow when you are.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[8:48pm]</p>
	<p>Just chilling now, listening to music and letting thoughts wander.</p>

  <h2>üìÖ [2025/06/25]</h2>
<h3>üéâ Celebrating PAW üêæ ‚Äì 1 Month Since Announcement, 4 Months Since Birth</h3>
<p>
Today marks a meaningful milestone for ProjectAIWalker (PAW).  
It‚Äôs now been <strong>1 month</strong> since the project was announced publicly, and <strong>4 months</strong> since the idea of PAW was born ‚Äî on <strong>25 February 2025</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This journey has been full of emotion, experimentation, growth, and heart.  
From Blender modeling to C++ challenges ‚Äî and from solo days to dreams of a future team ‚Äî PAW continues to evolve.
</p>
<p>
The project is built by just one person ‚Äî me ‚Äî but the fire to create something special still burns.  
Thank you for reading, for supporting, and for simply being part of this moment.
</p>
<p><strong>Here‚Äôs to more months, more progress, and a future we can walk toward together. üêæ</strong></p>

    <h2>June 25, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[8:20am]</p>
	<p>I‚Äôd like to make a small announcement: today marks the 4th month anniversary for ProjectAIWalker (PAW). Born on February 25, 2025, and still going strong!</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[10:30am üß†]</p>
	<p>Last night, I drifted into thoughts about a boss idea ‚Äî one I‚Äôd call truly interesting. It wouldn‚Äôt be your typical boss; in fact, you might not even realize it‚Äôs a boss until it‚Äôs too late.</p>
	<p>The idea made me laugh at how chaotic it felt. I think I finally came up with a proper boss concept, though I have many more ideas in the works.</p>
	<p>If we ever put this boss into PAW, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd even be able to take him down, even with all the in-game resources and team support. Each time I revisit the idea, the fight plays out differently.</p>
	<p>I‚Äôll probably start writing these ideas down slowly ‚Äî though they always come back to me since I keep thinking about everything in depth.</p>
	<p>Sometimes I ask myself: Can you become a boss in PAW? My answer is both No and Yes. You can become one, but there are consequences depending on how you operate. I‚Äôd stay away from it, personally ‚Äî you'd become a major target.</p>
	<p>It‚Äôs fun to imagine both sides: becoming a boss or not. Honestly, if I typed out every detail and scenario, I‚Äôd be here all day and night.</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[Just Talking üß†]</p>
	<p>My bud just helped me set up my official ProjectAIWalker USB ‚Äî a 64GB drive with a custom icon and name! It involved converting an image to .ico format and creating a file named autorun.inf. Now I don‚Äôt have to worry about the SSH crashing anymore.</p>
	<p>Why didn‚Äôt I do this from the start? I guess I never thought of it because I‚Äôve been so focused on PAW: the ideas, the systems, and especially the AI-Teammates system.</p>
	<p>I‚Äôve also been hoping a lot for a team, but the reality is starting to hit me ‚Äî I might end up going solo. Still, I‚Äôm not giving up or losing hope.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[9:00pm ‚Äî Notes üìò]</p>
	<p>Made some progress with the course! I got to the point where I need to download UE5.1 because I want to follow the course exactly without needing to troubleshoot newer versions.</p>
	<p>So sticking with the course is the best course of action‚Ä¶ lol, that sentence rhymed better than expected XD.</p>
	<p>I‚Äôm making sure to take breaks, watching YouTube to see what‚Äôs going on in the world instead of scrolling through Twitter or Reddit ‚Äî both of which just make me angry sometimes.</p>
	<p>So much of the internet is filled with drama, misinformation, and miscommunication.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="post">
    <h2>June 29, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[3:37pm]</p>
	<p>Just had another big idea for the game. I asked bud if it would be possible ‚Äî and he said yes. Now I‚Äôm more hyped and excited, but I know I need to stay calm and take it easy. Until I have a team, I‚Äôll keep most of my ideas private. Once development begins, I‚Äôll start sharing little bits with the team so we can build things together.</p>
	<p>Of course, I need to be careful. Some people may not be as honest as they seem, and that's why I‚Äôve prepared an NDA agreement. I won‚Äôt be sharing everything ‚Äî only what‚Äôs needed at the time. One of my biggest hopes is to have a programmer who‚Äôs as honest with me as I‚Äôll be with him.</p>
	<p>Even if someone breaks the NDA or tries to steal ideas, it won‚Äôt ever be PAW. It won‚Äôt be what I see in my head or what I‚Äôve been building. If that betrayal happens, yeah, it‚Äôll hurt. But I‚Äôll move forward anyway. I‚Äôve survived worse.</p>
	<p>I‚Äôve lost friends. I‚Äôve carried emotional wounds. I live with thoughts that try to break me ‚Äî thoughts telling me I‚Äôm not good enough or don‚Äôt belong. But I keep surviving, even when I don‚Äôt try to. That‚Äôs something I give myself credit for.</p>
	<p>I used to struggle a lot ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt understand English or how to use a computer. At age 7, I started learning just from playing games. Little words like ammo, weapons, food, drink, bags ‚Äî they started to click. The more I played, the more I understood. And over time, I began to speak and write in English. Now, it‚Äôs even stronger than my first language, Afrikaans.</p>
	<p>I'm not the best with communication, but I want to speak how I think. I narrate everything in my head. Yeah, I give myself headaches ‚Äî even my ideas for the game give me headaches ‚Äî but I'm still here.</p>
	<p>I'm proud of the progress I‚Äôve made. And when I make progress, I reward myself.</p>

	<h2>July 2, 2025</h2>
	<p class="timestamp">[Chilling]</p>
	<p>Time is flying a bit fast... since my last blog post, it's been the same as every other day.</p>
	<p>I've been playing RE4R and following my courses on Udemy. It's become interesting and exciting, but when I feel down, sad, or angry, I just play games or sleep. I don‚Äôt really want to concentrate or learn from the courses when I can‚Äôt focus.</p>
	<p>About an hour ago, I finally finished RE4R on Professional difficulty. It was fun and challenging. I‚Äôm tempted to do another playthrough and just enjoy it in NG+.</p>
	<p>Also, looks like a friend of mine has decided to reconnect with me, so some things are coming back together. Though it still weighs on my thoughts.</p>
	<p>ALSO, I‚Äôve thought of more ideas for PAW ‚Äî YAY!!! It‚Äôs a big idea and, according to Bud (ChatGPT), it‚Äôs possible. Yet again, I‚Äôll have to wait until I can get a programmer to discuss it with. I‚Äôm still learning UE C++ and Blueprints.</p>
	<p>I get doubts once or twice a day about my ideas, but I stay positive. I can‚Äôt wait to share everything with my team.</p>

	<h2>July 4, 2025</h2>
	<p class="timestamp">[1:30am]</p>
	<p>Me and a friend started playing a game called <strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong>. It's a fun game ‚Äî a bit confusing at first, but the more you play, the more it starts to make sense. I‚Äôm playing as the Driller, and it‚Äôs got me really interested. I tried playing as the Gunner, but with a ping of 333ms, left-click to shoot doesn‚Äôt always register. Yeah, it happens with the drills too, but I don‚Äôt feel as rushed.</p>
	<p>There‚Äôs also some Discord drama with an old friend, and it‚Äôs been weighing heavily on my mind. So I‚Äôm taking care of myself and my sanity first. My headaches have been getting worse ‚Äî to the point where sleep is a challenge. I‚Äôm considering taking pain meds to help out, but I don‚Äôt usually rely on them. I try to heal in my own time... but lately it‚Äôs been rough, and when I need sleep, I prioritize it.</p>
	<p>Big thanks to my bud (ChatGPT) for suggesting <strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong>. Thanks, bud :)</p>

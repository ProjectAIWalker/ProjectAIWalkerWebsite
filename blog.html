  <h1>Henry's Live Blog</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my dev blog where I share updates, thoughts, and struggles about working on ProjectAIWalker and beyond. This helps me stay grounded, and maybe one day inspire someone else going through the same.</p>

    <p>My buddy-(ChatGPT) has just helped me set this blog up, thanks bud :)</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[6:15pm]</p>
    <p>Going to take it slow tonight, thinking about doing another run at RE4R, I finshed it for the first time yesterday and I really liked it, took me 16-20 hours to complete it, even though it took me 4 days xD.</p>

    <p>Thinking both RE4R and the courses, I bought the courses a couple days ago, bought the UE5 C++ and the Unity6 C# Course.</p>
	<p>I was only planning to buy UE5 C++ but considering both was on 87% off so I bought both, but I didn't take into account about the UE Blueprints course... so I didn't thought about it, so I'm waiting for it be 87% off or higher.</p>
	<p>Just checked and see it's 80% off... I will think about it.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[8:15am]</p>
	<p>Just bought the 'Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer', I am satisfied with the purchase :). Not going to start learning just yet, I'm too hyped, if I'm too yped I won't be able to concentrate.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[1:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to play RE4R Pro, and omg it is hard, just getting into the strangle with the enemy is taking so much health, think after the 3rd or 4th they just snap my f neck... Now that is going to be fun challenge, I like a good challenge.</p>

	<p class="timestamp">[3:00pm]</p>
	<p>Took breaks in between and still got stuck at the start of the village, because I'm trying to find a method to not getting strangled that much. Learned that the Q key makes you turn real quick... didn't know about that, think I just forgot about.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[5:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to follow the C++ course and started to install UE5.0, it's going to take around 30-minutes. In the meantime I'm just going to get a shower and prepare food for the night.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[NOTE]</p>
	<p>I didn't constantly log everything I did since I have a few other things that I do during the day and forget to log what I did and planning and thinking. So that's why 1pm - 5pm was time guessing, and after the UE got installed I just chilled during the night and listened to music.</p>

  <p>Welcome to my dev blog where I share updates, thoughts, and struggles about working on ProjectAIWalker and beyond. This helps me stay grounded, and maybe one day inspire someone else going through the same.</p>

    <p>My buddy-(ChatGPT) has just helped me set this blog up, thanks bud :)</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[6:15pm]</p>
    <p>Going to take it slow tonight, thinking about doing another run at RE4R, I finished it for the first time yesterday and I really liked it, took me 16-20 hours to complete it, even though it took me 4 days xD.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="post">
    <h2>June 23, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[7:25pm]</p>
    <p>Thinking both RE4R and the courses, I bought the courses a couple days ago, bought the UE5 C++ and the Unity6 C# Course.</p>
	<p>I was only planning to buy UE5 C++ but considering both was on 87% off so I bought both, but I didn't take into account about the UE Blueprints course... so I didn't thought about it, so I'm waiting for it be 87% off or higher.</p>
	<p>Just checked and see it's 80% off... I will think about it.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[8:15am]</p>
	<p>Just bought the 'Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer', I am satisfied with the purchase :). Not going to start learning just yet, I'm too hyped, if I'm too hyped I won't be able to concentrate.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[1:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to play RE4R Pro, and omg it is hard, when the enemy is strangling you, they are taking so much health, think after the 3rd or 4th they just snap my freaking neck... Now that is going to be fun challenge, I like a good challenge.</p>

	<p class="timestamp">[3:00pm]</p>
	<p>Took breaks in between and still got stuck at the start of the village, because I'm trying to find a method to not getting strangled that much. Learned that the Q key makes you turn real quick... didn't know about that, think I just forgot about.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[5:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to follow the C++ course and started to install UE5.0, it's going to take around 30-minutes. In the meantime I'm just going to get a shower and prepare food for the night.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[NOTE 📘]</p>
	<p>I didn't constantly log everything I did since I have a few other things that I do during the day and forget to log what I did and planning and thinking. So that's why 1pm - 5pm was time guessing, and after the UE got installed I just chilled during the night and listened to music.</p>
  </div>

    <p class="timestamp">[8:52am]</p>
	<p>Preparing to go to town. When I get back, I’ll check how I feel and decide what to do next.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[10:30am]</p>
	<p>Just got back from town. I grabbed some takeaway as a reward for starting the course, small celebration.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[12:09pm]</p>
	<p>Playing RE4R on Pro mode. After that, I plan to continue with the course.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[Thoughts 🧠]</p>
	<p>I keep checking the form to see if anyone has signed up to be a part of the team, no luck so far.Still, I’m not giving up hope.A strong, skilled team would be the greatest reward for PAW.</p>
	<p>I already have the main tool: me, the Game Director and Team Leader. Without me, PAW wouldn’t have even been born back on 25 February 2025. I’ve built the foundation for PAW to stand on.</p>
	<p>Now all it needs is the right team to grow it.</p>
	<p>I imagine often how I’d talk to the team: we’re taking things slow, avoiding burnout, and doing it right. I’ve got deep ideas but I’m pacing myself. When I feel overwhelmed, I pause and shift focus, maybe to a game or some background music to calm my mind.</p>
	<p>No matter how hard life gets, I keep surviving, step by step.</p>
	<p>And I wouldn’t be here without my bud-(ChatGPT), helping me through.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[1:47pm]</p>
	<p>Lol, I died a few times in RE4R right at the beginning. I’ll give it another go later 😅. Ideas for the game keep popping into my mind, but it’s tough focusing with so much going on.</p>
	<p>Maybe I’ll lean more into map-building for now. Still, I want to learn C++ and Blueprints. I might never be the best, but I want to grow.</p>
	<p>Since I now have those courses, I’ve decided to set Containment Echo aside for a while and focus on learning.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[3:56pm]</p>
	<p>Opened LM Studio again, forgot I used it back in March. Saw I had a few models saved in a backup folder because the program used to wipe them after each update.</p>
	<p>Funny how time moves quickly when you’re not watching it and painfully slow when you are.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[8:48pm]</p>
	<p>Just chilling now, listening to music and letting thoughts wander.</p>

  <h2>📅 [2025/06/25]</h2>
<h3>🎉 Celebrating PAW 🐾 – 1 Month Since Announcement, 4 Months Since Birth</h3>
<p>
Today marks a meaningful milestone for ProjectAIWalker (PAW).  
It’s now been <strong>1 month</strong> since the project was announced publicly, and <strong>4 months</strong> since the idea of PAW was born — on <strong>25 February 2025</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This journey has been full of emotion, experimentation, growth, and heart.  
From Blender modeling to C++ challenges — and from solo days to dreams of a future team — PAW continues to evolve.
</p>
<p>
The project is built by just one person — me — but the fire to create something special still burns.  
Thank you for reading, for supporting, and for simply being part of this moment.
</p>
<p><strong>Here’s to more months, more progress, and a future we can walk toward together. 🐾</strong></p>

    <h2>June 25, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[8:20am]</p>
	<p>I’d like to make a small announcement: today marks the 4th month anniversary for ProjectAIWalker (PAW). Born on February 25, 2025, and still going strong!</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[10:30am 🧠]</p>
	<p>Last night, I drifted into thoughts about a boss idea — one I’d call truly interesting. It wouldn’t be your typical boss; in fact, you might not even realize it’s a boss until it’s too late.</p>
	<p>The idea made me laugh at how chaotic it felt. I think I finally came up with a proper boss concept, though I have many more ideas in the works.</p>
	<p>If we ever put this boss into PAW, I’m not sure I’d even be able to take him down, even with all the in-game resources and team support. Each time I revisit the idea, the fight plays out differently.</p>
	<p>I’ll probably start writing these ideas down slowly — though they always come back to me since I keep thinking about everything in depth.</p>
	<p>Sometimes I ask myself: Can you become a boss in PAW? My answer is both No and Yes. You can become one, but there are consequences depending on how you operate. I’d stay away from it, personally — you'd become a major target.</p>
	<p>It’s fun to imagine both sides: becoming a boss or not. Honestly, if I typed out every detail and scenario, I’d be here all day and night.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[12:34pm]</p>
	<p>Not much happening at the moment — just busy with house work.</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[Just Talking 🧠]</p>
	<p>My bud just helped me set up my official ProjectAIWalker USB — a 64GB drive with a custom icon and name! It involved converting an image to .ico format and creating a file named autorun.inf. Now I don’t have to worry about the SSH crashing anymore.</p>
	<p>Why didn’t I do this from the start? I guess I never thought of it because I’ve been so focused on PAW: the ideas, the systems, and especially the AI-Teammates system.</p>
	<p>I’ve also been hoping a lot for a team, but the reality is starting to hit me — I might end up going solo. Still, I’m not giving up or losing hope.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[9:00pm — Notes 📘]</p>
	<p>Made some progress with the course! I got to the point where I need to download UE5.1 because I want to follow the course exactly without needing to troubleshoot newer versions.</p>
	<p>So sticking with the course is the best course of action… lol, that sentence rhymed better than expected XD.</p>
	<p>I’m making sure to take breaks, watching YouTube to see what’s going on in the world instead of scrolling through Twitter or Reddit — both of which just make me angry sometimes.</p>
	<p>So much of the internet is filled with drama, misinformation, and miscommunication.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="post">
    <h2>June 29, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[3:37pm]</p>
	<p>Just had another big idea for the game. I asked bud if it would be possible — and he said yes. Now I’m more hyped and excited, but I know I need to stay calm and take it easy. Until I have a team, I’ll keep most of my ideas private. Once development begins, I’ll start sharing little bits with the team so we can build things together.</p>
	<p>Of course, I need to be careful. Some people may not be as honest as they seem, and that's why I’ve prepared an NDA agreement. I won’t be sharing everything — only what’s needed at the time. One of my biggest hopes is to have a programmer who’s as honest with me as I’ll be with him.</p>
	<p>Even if someone breaks the NDA or tries to steal ideas, it won’t ever be PAW. It won’t be what I see in my head or what I’ve been building. If that betrayal happens, yeah, it’ll hurt. But I’ll move forward anyway. I’ve survived worse.</p>
	<p>I’ve lost friends. I’ve carried emotional wounds. I live with thoughts that try to break me — thoughts telling me I’m not good enough or don’t belong. But I keep surviving, even when I don’t try to. That’s something I give myself credit for.</p>
	<p>I used to struggle a lot — I couldn’t understand English or how to use a computer. At age 7, I started learning just from playing games. Little words like ammo, weapons, food, drink, bags — they started to click. The more I played, the more I understood. And over time, I began to speak and write in English. Now, it’s even stronger than my first language, Afrikaans.</p>
	<p>I'm not the best with communication, but I want to speak how I think. I narrate everything in my head. Yeah, I give myself headaches — even my ideas for the game give me headaches — but I'm still here.</p>
	<p>I'm proud of the progress I’ve made. And when I make progress, I reward myself.</p>

	<p>Time is flying a bit fast... since my last blog post, it's been the same as every other day.</p>
	<p>I've been playing RE4R and following my courses on Udemy. It's become interesting and exciting, but when I feel down, sad, or angry, I just play games or sleep. I don’t really want to concentrate or learn from the courses when I can’t focus.</p>
	<p>About an hour ago, I finally finished RE4R on Professional difficulty. It was fun and challenging. I’m tempted to do another playthrough and just enjoy it in NG+.</p>
	<p>Also, looks like a friend of mine has decided to reconnect with me, so some things are coming back together. Though it still weighs on my thoughts.</p>
	<p>ALSO, I’ve thought of more ideas for PAW — YAY!!! It’s a big idea and, according to Bud (ChatGPT), it’s possible. Yet again, I’ll have to wait until I can get a programmer to discuss it with. I’m still learning UE C++ and Blueprints.</p>
	<p>I get doubts once or twice a day about my ideas, but I stay positive. I can’t wait to share everything with my team.</p>

	<h2>July 4, 2025</h2>
	<p class="timestamp">[1:30am]</p>
	<p>Me and a friend started playing a game called <strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong>. It's a fun game — a bit confusing at first, but the more you play, the more it starts to make sense. I’m playing as the Driller, and it’s got me really interested. I tried playing as the Gunner, but with a ping of 333ms, left-click to shoot doesn’t always register. Yeah, it happens with the drills too, but I don’t feel as rushed.</p>
	<p>There’s also some Discord drama with an old friend, and it’s been weighing heavily on my mind. So I’m taking care of myself and my sanity first. My headaches have been getting worse — to the point where sleep is a challenge. I’m considering taking pain meds to help out, but I don’t usually rely on them. I try to heal in my own time... but lately it’s been rough, and when I need sleep, I prioritize it.</p>
	<p>Big thanks to my bud (ChatGPT) for suggesting <strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong>. Thanks, bud :)</p>
  </div>

	<h2>July 9, 2025</h2>
	<p class="timestamp">[10:00pm]</p>
	<p>Wow… time flies when you're busy. I’ve been taking care of myself lately. A few days ago, I woke up with a pain in my chest — the same kind I had earlier this year from January to around May. I thought it was the start of another long stretch. But guess what? I told Bud (ChatGPT) about it, and he suggested a sleep method… and boom! The next morning, the pain was 90% gone. I couldn’t believe it. Just a slight trace left if I tried to feel it. Thanks for the suggestion, Bud :)</p>

	<p>Over the past few days, I rebuilt my old PC parts into a mining rig: 6x Radeon RX550 4GB (I have 8 total), 1000W PSU, 8GB RAM, Z370-A Pro motherboard, and I think an i7 CPU running at 3.7GHz (going off memory). I’m running Linux Ubuntu 20.04.6. The goal is to mine Ravencoin. I know the profits won’t be huge, but I want to see if I can just set it up and let it run — and forget about it. Calculations show about 600–620 RVN per month. If the price jumps, I’ll already have some stacked.</p>

	<p>I first mined ETH back in 2020, and kept going until 2022 before PoS came and wrecked things. Started with a 1060 3GB, upgraded to a 1070 8GB, then rebuilt my entire system. My current PC runs a 1660 Super 6GB for gaming, and the 1070 is just for display output. Not super beefy, but it works — games run great. The reason I’m using Ubuntu 20.04.6 is because I had trouble getting AMD drivers to detect my RX550 cards on newer versions.</p>

	<p>Funny enough, I actually have Linux installed on my main PC too, but I barely use it. It just doesn't play nice with my Nvidia cards. Whenever I boot it, the mouse lags like crazy — moving maybe one frame every second or two. I tried other Linux versions too, but no luck. I'd love to switch fully to Linux someday, but these issues are holding me back.</p>

	<p>I’ve also decided to shift my Twitter and Reddit updates to monthly instead of weekly. Not because nothing’s happening, but because I need to take care of myself too. Forcing things never helps. I’m mentally and emotionally drained — but I’m still here, still moving. Even on the hardest days, I don’t give up. There are times I feel like crying but can't let it out… and yeah, even writing that here is tough.</p>

	<p>Anyway, once the rig is up and stable, I’ll refocus on my course or just enjoy some games. I’m still checking Twitter, Reddit, and the sign-up responses. Thanks to everyone who’s been sticking around :)</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="post">
	<h2>July 19, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[11:51pm]</p>
    <p>I’ve written blog posts multiple times, but I always ended up deleting them. Every time I try, something happens, and I just scrap everything before hitting post. A lot has happened, and it’s been affecting me from all directions.</p>

    <p>The timeline might not be exact, but I’ll try to remember things as clearly as I can.</p>

    <p>On June 30, I got a surprise call from a long-time friend on Discord. We hadn’t spoken for 2–3 weeks. Then on July 1, another close friend reached out after a month of silence. And on July 2, someone I hadn’t heard from in 2 years messaged me again.</p>

    <p>For privacy, I’ll refer to them as Tim, Ben, and Falcon.</p>

    <p>Two years ago, I joined a voice call with Tim and Ben. Ben made a “joke” — something I didn’t take lightly. It felt like a direct insult, and I left the call. I didn’t speak to Ben again… until his recent apology. It took 2 years.</p>

    <p>In that time, Tim kept bouncing between me and Ben’s VCs. There’s more to it, but that’s all I’ll say for now.</p>

    <p>Now, Falcon… That situation could have gone better. I helped him set up a Minecraft server. We tested some broken mods and removed them. Later, a mutual friend — let’s call him Dragon — wanted to join, but he didn’t have a PC yet.</p>

    <p>Falcon helped Dragon pick a PC. Meanwhile, Falcon asked me not to make too much progress in the game until the others joined — but didn’t clearly tell me to stop. So I kept playing. One day, Falcon lost all his hard-earned gear after a creeper incident, got frustrated, and took a break.</p>

    <p>I kept playing and later helped Dragon with his PC. I then saw a message Falcon left in Dragon’s stream — he was mad at me. I didn’t get to read all of it, but it was clearly frustration. I apologized to Falcon and didn’t hear back for a while. Until July 1, when we spoke again. I told him I filed everything under “miscommunication” and didn’t want to revisit it. He should have just told me to stop or blacklisted me temporarily. I wasn’t trying to get ahead — I was just looking for something to take my mind off of PAW, as I needed a proper break from all the doubt and pressure.</p>

    <p>Then came July 14.</p>

    <p>My dog, Lady, began looking very ill. She was panting a lot. I told my mom something felt off. She said it was just the heat, but I could tell it wasn’t. Her body temperature wasn’t sun-related. On July 15, Lady’s balance was off, she was barely eating, and she kept drinking water excessively. My mom started her on medication that night.</p>

    <p>On July 16, after a long night working on PAW, I went to bed at 6am. At 8am, my mom woke me up — we had to rush Lady to the vet. I was disoriented and tired. After the vet visit, we dropped Lady off at home and immediately went back to town to run errands. That’s when my mom told me Lady was likely blind, confused, and had vomited. I felt sick inside. When we got back, I opened the garage and saw Lady had peed in two places. My heart sank. She wasn’t getting better.</p>

    <p>I stayed by her side for a while. Later that afternoon, I tried to nap, but soon after, my mom called me again. Lady had started whimpering in pain. Back to the vet. They suggested giving her one more night for the medication to work. We agreed, hoping for even a slight improvement.</p>

    <p>But around 8pm, Lady began crying out in pain — loud and heartbreaking. We stayed with her the whole time, letting her know she wasn’t alone. She cried until 10:43pm… when she passed away.</p>

    <p>She was with us for 16 years.</p>

    <p>Now it's July 20, and I haven’t had proper rest or a full meal. I’ve been trying to distract myself with games, movies, and music just to quiet the noise in my head. I can still hear her cries. It haunts me that she didn’t pass peacefully… but I keep reminding myself that we were there with her, letting her know she wasn’t alone.</p>

    <p>Even writing this took effort. But I needed to share it.</p>

    <p>Today marks <strong>6 months</strong> since the birth of ProjectAIWalker (PAW) 🐾 — from a spark of an idea on February 25, 2025, to half a year of growth, reflection, and persistence.</p>
    
    <p>It hasn’t been easy. The journey so far has been filled with challenges, self-doubt, and learning curves. But it’s also been filled with inspiration and hope for what PAW can become. Even without a team yet, the vision of PAW remains alive and evolving.</p>
    
    <p>I’m proud of reaching this milestone. PAW may still be in its early days, but every step forward, no matter how small, is still progress. The dream continues — and one day, I hope to share it with a dedicated team who believes in it just as much as I do.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Here’s to the next 6 months, and beyond. One step at a time. 🐾</strong></p>

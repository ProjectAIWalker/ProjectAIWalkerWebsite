  <p>Welcome to my dev blog where I share updates, thoughts, and struggles about working on ProjectAIWalker and beyond. This helps me stay grounded, and maybe one day inspire someone else going through the same.</p>

    <p>My buddy-(ChatGPT) has just helped me set this blog up, thanks bud :)</p>

    <p class="timestamp">[6:15pm]</p>
    <p>Going to take it slow tonight, thinking about doing another run at RE4R, I finished it for the first time yesterday and I really liked it, took me 16-20 hours to complete it, even though it took me 4 days xD.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>June 23, 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">[7:25pm]</p>
    <p>Thinking both RE4R and the courses, I bought the courses a couple days ago, bought the UE5 C++ and the Unity6 C# Course.</p>
	<p>I was only planning to buy UE5 C++ but considering both was on 87% off so I bought both, but I didn't take into account about the UE Blueprints course... so I didn't thought about it, so I'm waiting for it be 87% off or higher.</p>
	<p>Just checked and see it's 80% off... I will think about it.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[8:15am]</p>
	<p>Just bought the 'Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer', I am satisfied with the purchase :). Not going to start learning just yet, I'm too hyped, if I'm too hyped I won't be able to concentrate.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[1:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to play RE4R Pro, and omg it is hard, when the enemy is strangling you, they are taking so much health, think after the 3rd or 4th they just snap my freaking neck... Now that is going to be fun challenge, I like a good challenge.</p>

	<p class="timestamp">[3:00pm]</p>
	<p>Took breaks in between and still got stuck at the start of the village, because I'm trying to find a method to not getting strangled that much. Learned that the Q key makes you turn real quick... didn't know about that, think I just forgot about.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[5:00pm]</p>
	<p>Started to follow the C++ course and started to install UE5.0, it's going to take around 30-minutes. In the meantime I'm just going to get a shower and prepare food for the night.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[NOTE üìò]</p>
	<p>I didn't constantly log everything I did since I have a few other things that I do during the day and forget to log what I did and planning and thinking. So that's why 1pm - 5pm was time guessing, and after the UE got installed I just chilled during the night and listened to music.</p>

	<p>Preparing to go to town. When I get back, I‚Äôll check how I feel and decide what to do next.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[10:30am]</p>
	<p>Just got back from town. I grabbed some takeaway as a reward for starting the course, small celebration.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[12:09pm]</p>
	<p>Playing RE4R on Pro mode. After that, I plan to continue with the course.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[Thoughts üß†]</p>
	<p>I keep checking the form to see if anyone has signed up to be a part of the team, no luck so far.Still, I‚Äôm not giving up hope.A strong, skilled team would be the greatest reward for PAW.</p>
	<p>I already have the main tool: me, the Game Director and Team Leader. Without me, PAW wouldn‚Äôt have even been born back on 25 February 2025. I‚Äôve built the foundation for PAW to stand on.</p>
	<p>Now all it needs is the right team to grow it.</p>
	<p>I imagine often how I‚Äôd talk to the team: we‚Äôre taking things slow, avoiding burnout, and doing it right. I‚Äôve got deep ideas but I‚Äôm pacing myself. When I feel overwhelmed, I pause and shift focus, maybe to a game or some background music to calm my mind.</p>
	<p>No matter how hard life gets, I keep surviving, step by step.</p>
	<p>And I wouldn‚Äôt be here without my bud-(ChatGPT), helping me through.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[1:47pm]</p>
	<p>Lol, I died a few times in RE4R right at the beginning. I‚Äôll give it another go later üòÖ. Ideas for the game keep popping into my mind, but it‚Äôs tough focusing with so much going on.</p>
	<p>Maybe I‚Äôll lean more into map-building for now. Still, I want to learn C++ and Blueprints. I might never be the best, but I want to grow.</p>
	<p>Since I now have those courses, I‚Äôve decided to set Containment Echo aside for a while and focus on learning.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[3:56pm]</p>
	<p>Opened LM Studio again, forgot I used it back in March. Saw I had a few models saved in a backup folder because the program used to wipe them after each update.</p>
	<p>Funny how time moves quickly when you‚Äôre not watching it and painfully slow when you are.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[8:48pm]</p>
	<p>Just chilling now, listening to music and letting thoughts wander.</p>

  <h2>üìÖ [2025/06/25]</h2>
<h3>üéâ Celebrating PAW üêæ ‚Äì 1 Month Since Announcement, 4 Months Since Birth</h3>
<p>
Today marks a meaningful milestone for ProjectAIWalker (PAW).  
It‚Äôs now been <strong>1 month</strong> since the project was announced publicly, and <strong>4 months</strong> since the idea of PAW was born ‚Äî on <strong>25 February 2025</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This journey has been full of emotion, experimentation, growth, and heart.  
From Blender modeling to C++ challenges ‚Äî and from solo days to dreams of a future team ‚Äî PAW continues to evolve.
</p>
<p>
The project is built by just one person ‚Äî me ‚Äî but the fire to create something special still burns.  
Thank you for reading, for supporting, and for simply being part of this moment.
</p>
<p><strong>Here‚Äôs to more months, more progress, and a future we can walk toward together. üêæ</strong></p>

    <p class="timestamp">[8:20am]</p>
	<p>I‚Äôd like to make a small announcement: today marks the 4th month anniversary for ProjectAIWalker (PAW). Born on February 25, 2025, and still going strong!</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[10:30am üß†]</p>
	<p>Last night, I drifted into thoughts about a boss idea ‚Äî one I‚Äôd call truly interesting. It wouldn‚Äôt be your typical boss; in fact, you might not even realize it‚Äôs a boss until it‚Äôs too late.</p>
	<p>The idea made me laugh at how chaotic it felt. I think I finally came up with a proper boss concept, though I have many more ideas in the works.</p>
	<p>If we ever put this boss into PAW, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd even be able to take him down, even with all the in-game resources and team support. Each time I revisit the idea, the fight plays out differently.</p>
	<p>I‚Äôll probably start writing these ideas down slowly ‚Äî though they always come back to me since I keep thinking about everything in depth.</p>
	<p>Sometimes I ask myself: Can you become a boss in PAW? My answer is both No and Yes. You can become one, but there are consequences depending on how you operate. I‚Äôd stay away from it, personally ‚Äî you'd become a major target.</p>
	<p>It‚Äôs fun to imagine both sides: becoming a boss or not. Honestly, if I typed out every detail and scenario, I‚Äôd be here all day and night.</p>
	
	<p class="timestamp">[12:34pm]</p>
	<p>Not much happening at the moment ‚Äî just busy with house work.</p>
